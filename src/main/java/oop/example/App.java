Exercise 23 - Troubleshooting Car Issues
An expert system is a type of artificial intelligence program that uses a knowledge base and a set of
rules to perform a task that a human expert might do. Many websites are available that will help you
self-diagnose a medical issue by answering a series of questions. And many hardware and software
companies offer online troubleshooting tools to help people solve simple technical issues before
calling a human.

Create a program that walks the user through troubleshooting issues with a car. Use the following
decision tree to build the system:

@startuml
if (Is the car silent when you turn the key?) then (yes)
    if (Are the battery terminals corroded?) then (yes)
        :Clean terminals and try starting again.;
        stop
    else (no)
        :Replace cables and try again.;
        stop
    endif
else (no)
    if (Does the car make a slicking noise?) then (yes)
        :Replace the battery.;
        stop
    else (no)
        if (Does the car crank up but fail to start?) then (yes)
            :Check spark plug connections.;
            stop
        else (no)
            if (Does the engine start and then die?) then (yes)
                if (Does you car have fuel injection?) then (yes)
                    :Get it in for service.;
                    stop
                else (no)
                    :Check to ensure the choke is opening and closing.;
                    stop
                endif
            else (no)
                :This should not be possible.;
                stop
            endif
        endif
    endif
endif

Example Output:
Is the car silent when you turn the key? y
Are the battery terminals corroded? n
The battery cables may be damaged.
Replace cables and try again.

Constraint:
Ask only questions that are relevant to the situation and to the previous answers. Donâ€™t ask for all
inputs at once.

Challenge:
Investigate rules engines and inference engines. These are powerful ways to solve complex problems that
are based on
rules and facts. Identify a rules engine for your programming language and use it to solve this problem
